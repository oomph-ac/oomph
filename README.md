# Oomph
Oomph is a military-grade interception-based anti-cheat proxy for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

## How does Oomph work?
Oomph acts as an intermediary between your server and Minecraft clients, processing all packets sent by the client and the server. It performs various checks on all packets to detect potential cheats. This versatility lets Oomph function easily on different server software.

Oomph strives to be a highly performant player while also being able to detect a variety of cheats and exploits.

## Configuration
Oomph is undergoing a refactor, and the configuration is not yet complete.
